# MERN TRAINING

    - Installation 
        - NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/
        - NPM: Node Package Manager
    - HTML : Structure
      JS : Functionality/Behavior
      CSS: Presentation
    - Javascript
        Primitive Types: number, string & boolean
        Function are also treated as objects (pass them function, return from function)
        Objects in JS
        JSON
        Each function forms its own lexical scope
        Sending data to server
            1. Synch: Form tag
            2. Asynch: AJAX
        Jquery is already available inbuilt functions
    - NPM 
        Install Json-server for (Http GET, POST ...)
        Jquery $.get, $post ... to send/recieve from Json-server
    - ES6
        Contains some new language features:
        Promises, Class syntax, Rest, Let, Interpolation.....
        Transcompile ES6 to browser compatible ES5 
    - NPM packages run local
        npm init
        npm i <package_name>
        npm run <script_name>
    - Writing first program in React
        - Globally Install create-react-app : npm i -g create-react-app
        - Create a project : npx create-react-app <name-of-app>
        - cd my-first-app
        - npm start
    - Create component in React
        - function or class syntax
        - render method that determines the look of feel
        - other methods to handle user event
        - props (passed into component), state (belongs to the component)
        - props are read-only, state can changed but by using setState method

    React
        - State & Props
        - Parent Child communication
        - Http communication (fetch, axios)
        - Lifecycle
        - Single Page Application (faster n responseive app)
        - React Bootstrap
        - Class vs Functional Components (useState, useEffect)
        - Hooks (useEffect), Custom Hooks
        - Controlled & Uncontrolled
        - Redux
            - Global state as single source of truth: consistent data
            - No lifting state, making it availble in component hierarchies
            - Structure (specific spots)
            - Context API (limitations) for global state (simple replacement for Redux)
            - Disadvantages: Complex code : store, middleware, thunk, actions, dispatch
            - Redux Saga (Generators)
        - React Bootstrap
        - Styling (Login/Registration), Validations(checkboxes),  useContext, lazyLoading
