    JS Concepts
        JavaScript (JS) is a interpreted with first-class functions.
        JavaScript is a prototype-based, 
        single-threaded: (no concurrency);
        dynamic language,
        supporting object-oriented (inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction) 
        imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

         Data Types
            - Primitives: string, number & boolean
            - Objects {}, function constructor
        Functions
            - First class citizens (passed into and returned from functions)
            - Scope(Scope Creation, Execution)
            - Function Constructor
            - Prototypes (Common place for all objects)
        Scope: Global, Function, Block(let)
        String, Numbers, Arrays, Date, Math
        let courses = [
            {title: "Ember"}, 
            {title: "React"}, 
            {title: "Angular"}
        ]
        courses.sort((a, b)=>a.title - b.title)
        console.log(courses)
        new Date()
        new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds)
        new Date(milliseconds)

        try {
        Block of code to try
        }
        catch(err) {
        Block of code to handle errors
        }
        finally {
        Block of code to be executed regardless of the try / catch result
        }

        DOM Manipuation
        Data Types
            - Primitives: string, number & boolean
            - Objects and functions?
        Troubleshooting
        Global objects 
        Dynamic and Mutable objects
        Prototypes & Prototypal nature (with diagram)
        Loosely typed (overloading)
        Inheritance and polymorphism
        Setter & getters
        Async -> Callback, promises, Async/Await
        Closure, Memoization, Currying (practical examples)
        Classes: Math, Date, String
        Arrays
        ABC functions and execution context
        this
        Exception & Errors
        AJAX
        Arrow Functions
        Regular Expressions

        ES6 features
        Modules, Webpack & Gulp
